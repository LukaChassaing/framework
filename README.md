# LC Framework

Minimal php framework for easy application development.
Inspired a little by Symfony, powered by twig.

## Requirements
- Apache server
- PHP 7
- Composer
- MySQL (optionnal)

## Getting started
1. Clone the repository
2. Change the application name in `config/general.conf` and rename your folder the same.
3. Install dependencies
```bash
composer install
```
4. Define your routes in `config/routes.conf`

That's all folks!
